## Yet Another Grappling Hook Plugin
YAGHP adds grappling hooks. Please, attempt to contain your amazement and disbelief.

Grappling hooks are crafted by shapelessly combining an arrow, a lead, and a tripwire hook. Grappling hooks can only be shot out of crossbows unless you don't use Paper, in which case you totally can, but it just straight up breaks them because I'm lazy.

YAGHP is not configurable. If you want options, please seek out one of the probably hundreds of competitors.
